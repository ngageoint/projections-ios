# Projections iOS

#### Projections Lib ####

The Projections Library was developed at the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)](http://www.nga.mil/) in collaboration with [BIT Systems](https://www.caci.com/bit-systems/). The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions.

### About ###

[Projections](http://ngageoint.github.io/projections-ios/) is an iOS library for performing projection conversions between coordinates.

For conversions between geometries, see [Simple Features Projections](https://ngageoint.github.io/simple-features-proj-ios/).
