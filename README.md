# Projections iOS

#### Projections Lib ####

The Projections Library was developed at the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)](http://www.nga.mil/) in collaboration with [BIT Systems](https://www.caci.com/bit-systems/). The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions.

### About ###

[Projections](http://ngageoint.github.io/projections-ios/) is an iOS library for performing projection conversions between coordinates.

For conversions between geometries, see [Simple Features Projections](https://ngageoint.github.io/simple-features-proj-ios/).

```objectivec

// CLLocationCoordinate2D coordinate = ...

### Build ###

[![Build & Test](https://github.com/ngageoint/projections-ios/workflows/Build%20&%20Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ngageoint/projections-ios/actions/workflows/build-test.yml)

**IMPORTANT** -
Be sure your Mac has the `autoconf`, `automake`, and `glibtoolize` utilities.  These are required to build
the [proj4-ios](https://cocoapods.org/pods/proj4-ios) dependency.  Without them, `pod install` will fail.  The easiest way to get these is to [`brew install`](https://brew.sh/) them:
```
brew install automake
brew install libtool
```

Build this repository using Xcode and/or CocoaPods:

    pod repo update
    pod install

Open proj-ios.xcworkspace in Xcode or build from command line:

    xcodebuild -workspace 'proj-ios.xcworkspace' -scheme proj-ios build

Run tests from Xcode or from command line:

    xcodebuild test -workspace 'proj-ios.xcworkspace' -scheme proj-ios -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14'

### Include Library ###

See the [above note](https://github.com/ngageoint/projections-ios#build) about `automake` and `glibtoolize`.

Include this repository by specifying it in a Podfile using a supported option.

Pull from [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/proj-ios):

    pod 'proj-ios', '~> 1.0.5'

Pull from GitHub:

    pod 'proj-ios', :git => 'https://github.com/ngageoint/projections-ios.git', :branch => 'master'
    pod 'proj-ios', :git => 'https://github.com/ngageoint/projections-ios.git', :tag => '1.0.5'

Include as local project:

    pod 'proj-ios', :path => '../projections-ios'

### Swift ###

To use from Swift, import the proj-ios bridging header from the Swift project's bridging header

    #import "proj-ios-Bridging-Header.h"

```swift

// CLLocationCoordinate2D coordinate = ...

let projection1 : PROJProjection = PROJProjectionFactory.projection(withAuthority: PROJ_AUTHORITY_EPSG, andIntCode: PROJ_EPSG_WEB_MERCATOR)
let projection2 : PROJProjection = PROJProjectionFactory.projection(withName: "EPSG:4326")
let projection3 : PROJProjection = PROJProjectionFactory.projection(withAuthority: PROJ_AUTHORITY_EPSG, andIntCode: 3123,
    andParams: "+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=121 +k=0.99995 +x_0=500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=clrk66 "
        + "+towgs84=-127.62,-67.24,-47.04,-3.068,4.903,1.578,-1.06 +units=m +no_defs")
let projection4 : PROJProjection = PROJProjectionFactory.projection(byDefinition: "PROJCS[\"Lambert_Conformal_Conic (1SP)\","
    + "GEODCRS[\"GCS_North_American_1983\","
    + "DATUM[\"North_American_Datum_1983\","
    + "SPHEROID[\"GRS_1980\",6371000,0]],"
    + "PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0],"
    + "UNIT[\"Degree\",0.017453292519943295]],"
    + "PROJECTION[\"Lambert_Conformal_Conic_1SP\"],"

    + "PARAMETER[\"false_northing\",0],"
    + "PARAMETER[\"standard_parallel_1\",25],"
    + "UNIT[\"Meter\",1],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9801\"]]")

let transform : PROJProjectionTransform = projection1.transformation(with: projection2)
let inverseTransform : PROJProjectionTransform = transform.inverseTransformation()

let transformed : CLLocationCoordinate2D = transform.transform(coordinate)
let inverseTransformed : CLLocationCoordinate2D = inverseTransform.transform(transformed)
